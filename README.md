## Enhancements Applied
You can view restaurants, add them to favorites and add reviews to them. The project has been enhanced to be more accessible, available for offline usage using service workers and responsive for all device sizes.

### How To Run The Project?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. Fork and clone mws-restaurant-stage-3 (https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) and follow the instructions provided to run it

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
